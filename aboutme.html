                <h> Favorite subject is Math</h>
                <p> The reason why my favorite subject is math, is the way it's formed. 
			It's ways solving to comeout with one or more answers. Became interested in math becaues it is easy if you understand the concepts of it.
			The way it's formed is like steps with an different outcomes. 
			I refer life as a math problem because in life there are steps leading towards an outcome.</p>
                <h> Video Games</h>
                <p> Games I really like to play are like mobile games and some console games. 
			 My favorite type of game are open world, multiplayer games. One game I play with friends would be Dayz.
