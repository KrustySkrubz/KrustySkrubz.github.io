                <h> Favorite subject i as Math</h>
                <p> The reason why my favorite subject is math, is the way it's formed. 
			It's great to have steps to solve a problem which applies to real life, a problem takes step to solve.</p>
                <h> Video Games</h3>
                <p> Games I really like to play are like mobile games and some console games. 
			 My favorite type of game are open world, multiplayer games. One game I play with friends would be Dayz.
